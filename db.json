This can help to reduce the risk of injuries occurring, and will help athletes to perform at their best.\n\n#  What are some of the common injuries that a sports physio would treat?\n\nSports physiotherapists are specialists in the assessment and treatment of injuries and conditions caused or sustained during sporting activity. Some of the most common injuries that they treat include:\n\n- Ankle sprain\n- Knee ligament tear\n- Hamstring strain\n- Shin splint\n\nAnkle sprain is one of the most common injuries sustained during sport. It is caused by the ankle twisting beyond its normal range, resulting in damage to the ligaments that support the joint. Physiotherapy treatment for ankle sprain includes range of motion exercises, massage, and ultrasound therapy to promote healing.\n\nKnee ligament tear is a relatively common injury in contact sports such as football and rugby. It occurs when the knee is twisted or hyperextended, resulting in damage to one or more of the four ligaments that stabilize the joint. Treatment for knee ligament tear typically involves physiotherapy rehabilitation to strengthen and stabilize the knee joint.\n\nHamstring strain is a very common injury among runners and other athletes who participate in sports that require lots of running or jumping. It occurs when one or more of the hamstring muscles are overloaded, causing them to stretch beyond their normal range and tear. Treatment for hamstring strain usually involves a combination of rest, ice therapy, massage, and ultrasound therapy.\n\nShin splint is an inflammation of the tissue around the shin bone that is often caused by running on hard surfaces or overtraining. Physiotherapy treatment for shin splint usually involves a combination of ice therapy, massage, stretches, and heel drops.\n\n#  What is the difference between a sports physio and a physiotherapist?\n\nThere are many misconceptions about the differences between sports physios and physiotherapists. The most common one is that sports physios only treat sport-related injuries, but this is not true. Sports physios are specialists in the treatment of sporting injuries, but physiotherapists are able to treat a wider range of conditions.\n\nBoth sports physios and physiotherapists use a variety of treatment methods including massage, joint manipulation, exercise therapy and electrotherapy. However, sports physios may also use other techniques such as manual therapy or dry needling.\n\nSports physios usually have a higher level of qualification than physiotherapists and they often have specialist knowledge in specific areas such as musculoskeletal medicine or concussion. This means that they can offer a more tailored treatment plan for their patients.\n\nPhysiotherapists generally work in private practices, hospitals or clinics, whereas sports physios often work in sports clubs or with sporting teams.\n\n#  What is the most important thing for an athlete to do when they get injured?\n\nWhen an athlete gets injured, the most important thing for them to do is to take time to heal. This means that they need to rest and not participate in any physical activity. In many cases, athletes try to rush back to the game before they are healed, which can lead to more injuries.\n\nAnother important thing for athletes to do when they get injured is to see a doctor. Many times, athletes try to treat their injuries on their own, but this can often lead to further damage. Seeing a doctor will help ensure that the athlete gets the right treatment and heals properly.\n\nFinally, athletes should stay positive during the healing process. Getting injured can be frustrating and it may be tempting to become discouraged. However, if an athlete stays positive and focuses on getting better, they will be able to return to the game stronger than before.","source":"_posts/What-are-the-five-fast-facts-about-sports-physio.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What are the five fast facts about sports physio\ndate: 2022-08-26 17:56:53\ncategories:\n- Sports Physio\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What are the five fast facts about sports physio?\n\n1.
