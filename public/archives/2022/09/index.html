Sports massage includes a variety of techniques that are used to manipulate the soft tissues of the body. These techniques can include deep tissue massage, trigger point therapy, and stretching. Sports massage can be used before, during, or after an event to help the athlete prepare for or recover from competition.
Many professional athletes use sports massage as part of their regular training routine. This helps to improve flexibility, reduce muscle tension, and prevent injuries. Sports massage can also be used to speed up the healing process after an injury has occurred.
If you are interested in trying sports massage, it is important to find a qualified therapist who has experience working with athletes. Be sure to discuss your goals and any existing injuries with your therapist before starting treatment.
