The Venetian and The Palazzo are both owned and operated by the Las Vegas Sands Company. They are sister casinos, and offer nearly identical gaming and hotel options. The only real difference is that The Venetian is slightly older, having opened in 1999. Both properties have large, luxurious rooms, tons of boutique shops and restaurants, and extremely high ceilings.

The casino at each property offers a wide variety of table games, including blackjack, roulette, craps, and baccarat. But the real attraction for most guests is the expansive poker room. The Venetian has a total of 67 tables, while Palazzo features 68. In addition to Texas hold’em, both rooms offer a variety of other poker variants, including Omaha and seven-card stud.

The minimums at both casinos are relatively low, making it easy for penny pinchers to get in on the action. The Venetian starts its tables at just $1/$2 blinds, while Palazzo goes as low as 25 cents/$0.50. And if you’re feeling lucky (or just have a lot of money burning a hole in your pocket) both casinos offer high-roller rooms with much higher limits.

If you’re looking for a good place to play Texas hold’em in Las Vegas, you really can’t go wrong with either The Venetian or Palazzo. Just be sure to bring your A game – these places are serious poker destinations!
