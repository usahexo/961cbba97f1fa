#  Neymar Jr. Scores Ninth Straight Win for PSG

Neymar Jr. scores again as Paris Saint-Germain extend their Ligue 1 lead to nine points Neymar Jr. scores ninth straight win for PSG

PARIS, France - Neymar Jr. scored the only goal of the match on Sunday night as Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) extended their unbeaten run in Ligue 1 to nine matches with a 1-0 win over Olympique Lyonnais.

The 27-year-old Brazilian now has 14 goals in as many appearances in all competitions for his new club this season, and he is starting to look like the player who cost a world-record 222 million euros ($249 million) from Barcelona last summer.

"It was important to win tonight because it means we open up a nine-point lead at the top of the league," Neymar said in televised comments after the match. "We're happy with that, but we must continue working hard."

PSG coach Unai Emery was also pleased with the victory. "It's always difficult against Lyon, they are a good side," Emery said. "We played intelligently and took our chances." 

With the result, PSG moved on to 36 points from 14 matches, while Lyon are second on 27 points. Third-place Marseille have 24 points after they were held to a 0-0 draw by Toulouse earlier on Sunday.

#  9 in a Row: Paris Saint-Germain Remains Undefeated

After nine consecutive wins in all competitions, Paris Saint-Germain has not lost a match since their 2-1 defeat to Monaco in the Coupe de la Ligue final.

Neymar Jr. opened the scoring for PSG in their first Ligue 1 match of the season against Guingamp before Edinson Cavani added a second for good measure; Kylian Mbappé and Ángel Di María also got on the scoresheet in that 5-0 win. Neymar Jr. then bagged two goals each against Toulouse (4-0) and Lyon (5-0), with Cavani and Mbappé also grabbing braces, as the team made it six wins from six in Ligue 1. 

A 3-2 victory over Liverpool at Anfield saw Neymar Jr., Mbappé and Cavani all score once, taking Paris Saint-Germain into the Champions League group stages as they looked to defend their title; they would do so, topping Group C ahead of Napoli, Liverpool and Red Star Belgrade. 

November saw them pitted against Strasbourg in the Coupe de la Ligue quarterfinals, with Neymar Jr. grabbing a hat-trick in their 5-2 home win which effectively sent them through to the semifinal stage 6-2 on aggregate. They faced off against Monaco in that semifinal, losing 2-1 on the night but progressing nonetheless 3-2 on aggregate to set up a final clash with Guingamp – who had surprisingly knocked out Lyon en route to this stage.

Neymar Jr. was once again pivotal as he notched up his ninth goal in nine games across all competitions to hand PSG an early lead, with Cavani adding a second just before half time; another goal from Mbappé after the interval sealed an emphatic 3-0 victory and an incredible ninth consecutive win for Thomas Tuchel’s men. This unbeaten streak stretches back now over thirteen matches, with only one draw included (against Racing Strasbourg).

#  Baccarat: Neymar Jr. Nets Another Goal, PSG Continues Winning Streak

Neymar Jr. netted another goal, leading Paris Saint-Germain to a victory against FC Metz on Saturday. This was Neymar Jr.’s seventh goal in the past four matches and his league-leading fifteenth of the season. PSG is now on an eight-match winning streak in all competitions, putting them atop Ligue 1 and into the Champions League knockout stages.

Baccarat is one of the most popular casino games and Neymar Jr. is one of its biggest stars. The Brazilian has scored some amazing goals in his career, but this latest one against Metz may have been his best yet. With PSG up 2-0 in the second half, Neymar Jr. took a pass from Angel Di Maria and blasted it into the top corner of the net, giving his team a 3-0 lead.

The win against Metz keeps PSG on track for their ultimate goal: winning the French championship. They are currently six points ahead of second-place Monaco and look poised to take home the title this year. Their success in Europe has also been impressive, as they have already clinched a spot in the knockout stages of the Champions League.

There’s no doubt that Neymar Jr. is a key player for both PSG and Brazil’s national team. He brings a level of excitement to the game that few other players can match and his skills make him nearly impossible to stop. If he can continue scoring goals at this rate, there’s no telling how far PSG can go this season.

#  Paris Saint-Germain Keeps Rolling with Ninth Straight Victory

After cruising through their group stage in the Champions League, Paris Saint-Germain have taken their dominant form into Ligue 1 play. The Parisians demolished Monaco last Saturday, 7-1, to notch their ninth straight victory and keep a perfect record at home in league play.

The goals came early and often for PSG, with Neymar Jr. (2), Kylian Mbappé (2), Edinson Cavani, and Marco Verratti all finding the back of the net before halftime. Mbappé’s brace gives him an absurd 14 goals in 12 Ligue 1 appearances this season. Fellow youngster Christopher Nkunku added insult to injury with a goal in stoppage time to round out the scoring.

It was a frustrating day for Monaco, who looked helpless against the potent PSG attack. Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subašić was repeatedly tested and ultimately conceded seven goals on just 24 shots faced. This match also served as a reminder of Monaco’s struggles since selling star striker Kylian Mbappé last summer.

Elsewhere in Ligue 1 this past weekend, Marseille continued their resurgence with a 2-0 win over Bordeaux. Dimitri Payet and Florian Thauvin scored the goals for Marseille, who are now unbeaten in six matches and sit in second place in the table, just two points behind PSG.

While it may appear that PSG are running away with the title, there is still much soccer left to be played. Marseille and Lyon both have enough talent to make a title challenge, and teams like Rennes and Saint-Étienne will be looking to move up the table as well. It should be an exciting second half of the season in France’s top division!

On Saturday evening, Neymar Jr. netted PSG's second goal in their 3-0 home win against Nimes Olympique, extending his record as the player with the most goals in Ligue 1 consecutively.

Neymar Jr. has now scored in nine consecutive appearances in all competitions and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. After taking a brief break from international duty with Brazil, Neymar Jr. has come back firing on all cylinders for club and country and shows no signs of fatigue.

PSG Manager Thomas Tuchel was understandably pleased with his player's performance: "He is unbelievable - he cannot stop scoring at the moment."

It will be interesting to see how far Neymar Jr. can take PSG in the Champions League this year, with many believing that they are one of the favorites to win the tournament. Neymar Jr.'s individual performances will be crucial if they are to go all the way.
