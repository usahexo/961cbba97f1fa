#  Take a trip to the Hoover Dam!

The Hoover Dam is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the United States, and for good reason. This engineering marvel is a sight to behold. At over 700 feet high and 1100 feet long, it’s hard not to be impressed by the scale of the dam.

Commissioned in 1931 by President Herbert Hoover, the dam was built to provide hydroelectric power to the Southwest and control flooding along the Colorado River. The construction process was dangerous and involved more than 5 million cubic yards of concrete and 45000 tons of steel. Despite these challenges, the Hoover Dam was completed ahead of schedule and under budget.

Today, the Hoover Dam draws more than a million visitors a year. Tourists can take a walk across the top of the dam, visit the power plant, or enjoy one of the many recreational activities available at Lake Mead, which was created by the Hoover Dam. Whether you’re a history buff or just looking for a fun day trip, be sure to add the Hoover Dam to your list of must-see destinations!
