#  Casino Heists From Around the World: Estonia Edition

A casino heist is the robbery of a casino. These robberies can be extremely lucrative for the perpetrators, as casinos typically keep large sums of money on site. Heist methods vary, but typically include burglary, theft, or robbery.

One of the most famous casino heists in history occurred at the Stardust Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada in 1978. The robbery was orchestrated by Anthony “Tony” Spilotro and his team of mobsters, who made off with over $1 million in cash and chips.

More recently, an Estonian computer hacker managed to steal over $1 million from a number of different European casinos between 2012 and 2016. The hacker took advantage of a vulnerability in the software used by the casinos, which allowed him to covertly extract funds from their accounts.

While Estonia may be best known for its cybersecurity capabilities, it would appear that its casinos are also vulnerable to attack. In light of this recent heist, it will be interesting to see whether or not tighter security measures are put into place to prevent future incidents.
