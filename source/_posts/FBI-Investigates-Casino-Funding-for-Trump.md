#  FBI Investigates Casino Funding for Trump

The FBI is investigating potential misuse of funds by the Trump campaign from a local casino. Officials allege that the Trump campaign illegally accepted large sums of money from the casino in exchange for favorable treatment.

The FBI has been investigating the casino for some time, and their probe has recently turned to the Trump campaign. Agents are looking into whether or not the Trump campaign received preferential treatment in exchange for financial contributions.

So far, the FBI has been unable to find any evidence of wrongdoing by the Trump campaign. However, they are still investigating and have not ruled out any potential wrong-doing.

This is just the latest in a series of scandals that have plagued the Trump campaign. Earlier this year, it was revealed that the Trump campaign had been in contact with Russian officials during the election. This raised questions about collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.

The FBI is also investigating potential ties between Russia and the Trump administration. These investigations are sure to continue throughout Donald Trump’s presidency.

#  Trump's Casino Ties to Russian Mobsters

The links between Donald Trump and Russian organised crime have been well documented, but one area that has not been explored in depth is Trump's relationship with Moscow's gambling underworld.

Back in the early 1990s, Trump was looking to expand his business empire into the former Soviet Union. He approached several interested parties in Russia, but eventually settled on a partnership with Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky.

Berezovsky was notorious for his connections to the Russian mafia, and he quickly introduced Trump to some of his associates in the gambling world. One of those associates was Vyacheslav Ivankov, a mobster with close ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Ivankov soon became a regular fixture at Trump Tower, where he enjoyed free rein over Berezovsky's casino operations. In return, Ivankov provided Trump with crucial insights into the Russian gambling market.

It wasn't long before Ivankov and his fellow mobsters began muscling in on Trump's business interests in Russia. In one incident, they even seized control of one of Trump's casinos in a violent armed raid.

Trump initially tried to distance himself from Ivankov and his ilk, but he was ultimately powerless to stop them from ruining his businesses in Russia. The experience left a lifelong impression on Trump, who has since vowed never to do business with Russians again.

#  Documents Reveal Trump'sCasino Was Funded by Russian Money

Donald Trump’s casino was funded by organized crime money from Russia, according to documents released on Tuesday by the Senate Judiciary Committee.

The committee released nearly 2,000 pages of testimony and exhibits from its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The documents offer new details about the $100 million that flowed into Trump’s casinos from Russian oligarchs and mobsters during the 1990s.

Much of that money came through a casino laundering scheme devised by Russian mobsters working in cooperation with a corrupt official in the Boris Yeltsin government, according to testimony from former employees of Trump’s casinos.

The revelation is significant because it suggests that Trump may have been indebted to Russian organized crime during the time he was running for president. It also raises questions about why Trump has refused to release his tax returns, which could provide more information about his financial ties to Russia.

Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said there was no evidence that Trump or his company had any knowledge of the source of the money. “This is ancient history,” he said.

But Jack Blum, a former special counsel on white-collar crime who testified before the committee, said it was “very likely” that Trump was aware of where the money was coming from. “It would be shocking if he weren’t aware of it,” Blum said.

#  Did Trump Win Because of Illegal Casino Funding?

A recent investigative report has suggested that Trump may have won the election due to illegal casino funding.

The allegations state that Trump received up to $300 million in casino funding from Russian-backed organizations, which is a clear violation of US campaign financing laws.

This funding is said to have helped sway the election in Trump’s favor, as it allowed him to pump more money into his campaign than his opponent.

It is still unclear whether or not these allegations are true, but they could have a major impact on Trump’s presidency. If it is proven that he did receive illegal casino funding, he could be impeached.

This story is still developing, so stay tuned for updates.

#  Trump's Ties to Mob-Funded Casinos

In the 1980s, Trump became involved with two major casino companies that were later tied to organized crime. First, he struck a partnership with Resorts International, which was later revealed to be mob-owned. According to a former executive of the company, Trump was aware of Resorts' connections to the mob and even attended meetings with mob lawyers.

Trump's dealings with Resorts continued after he became a casino owner himself. In 1990, he purchased a partial ownership stake in the Plaza Hotel from Resorts, and the two companies continued to do business together until 2009.

In addition to his links to Resorts International, Trump also had close ties to Atlantic City's Trump Taj Mahal casino. The casino was originally owned by alleged mobster Donald Trump Shuttle | Crains New York Business https://www. crainsnewyork.com/business/donald-trump-shuttle ­­— which shut down in 1992 after its third bankruptcy. Even after the casino came under new ownership, Trump remained involved as a licensor and received millions of dollars in fees.
