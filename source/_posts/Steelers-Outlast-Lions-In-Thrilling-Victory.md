#  Steelers Outlast Lions In Thrilling Victory

The Steelers managed to pull out a thrilling victory against the Lions in Week 8, thanks to a late touchdown from Antonio Brown.

Detroit got on the board first with a field goal in the opening quarter, but Pittsburgh would answer back with a touchdown drive of their own to take the lead. The Lions would retake the lead early in the second half, but Pittsburgh would again respond with a touchdown to make it 14-13.

In the fourth quarter, the Steelers took control of the game. Ben Roethlisberger connected with Brown for a gain of 29 yards and then hit him again in the end zone for a touchdown, giving Pittsburgh a 21-13 lead. The Lions wouldn’t go down without a fight, scoring another touchdown to make it 21-20 with just over two minutes left in the game.

But Pittsburgh’s defense would hold strong, preventing Detroit from scoring again and securing the victory for the Steelers. It was an exciting win that moved Pittsburgh to 5-2-1 on the season.

#  Steelers Find A Way To Win When It Matters Most

The Pittsburgh Steelers have been one of the NFL's more consistent teams in recent years, making the playoffs in each of the last three seasons. However, they had yet to win a postseason game until last weekend. Facing a fourth-and-five from their own 33-yard line with just over two minutes remaining and down by four points, the Steelers found a way to win when it mattered most.

Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger completed a six-yard pass to Antonio Brown to keep the drive alive, and then hit Jesse James for an 18-yard touchdown pass with just 28 seconds remaining to give the Steelers a dramatic 36-35 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. It was a heart-stopping finish to what had been an otherwise forgettable game for Pittsburgh.

The Steelers got off to a shaky start, as Roethlisberger was intercepted on the team's first possession. Jacksonville then took a 14-0 lead on two touchdown passes from Blake Bortles to Marqise Lee. The Steelers finally got on the scoreboard late in the second quarter, when Roethlisberger hit rookie JuJu Smith-Schuster for an incredible 97-yard touchdown pass.

Smith-Schuster finished the game with seven catches for 193 yards and two touchdowns, becoming just the third rookie in NFL history to record 200 yards receiving in a playoff game. The Steelers took a 15-14 lead into halftime and extended it to 21-14 early in the third quarter. However, Jacksonville responded with two more touchdowns to take a 28-21 lead into the fourth quarter.

Including last weekend's game, the Steelers are now 4-0 this season in games decided by three points or fewer. That clutch gene has come in handy during this improbable postseason run, as they have now won three consecutive games after trailing by at least 14 points. Led by Brown and Smith-Schuster, Pittsburgh's high-powered offense is averaging 31 points per game in the playoffs.

The defense has also played well, holding opponents to an average of 17 points per game. The Steelers will need another strong performance from both sides of the ball if they hope to upset top seed New England Patriots on Sunday and reach Super Bowl LII.

#  Steelers Prove They Are The Real Deal, Beat The Board

The Pittsburgh Steelers were hit with a lot of injuries this season and there were doubts if they would be able to make the playoffs. However, they proved they are still a force to be reckoned with and beat the board, earning a bye week and home field advantage through the playoffs.

Their biggest test of the season came in Week 15 when they played the New England Patriots. This was a rematch of the AFC championship game from last year, which the Steelers lost. The Patriots had won all three previous meetings between the two teams, but this time things were different.

Led by Ben Roethlisberger’s 5 touchdown passes, the Steelers routed the Patriots 39-26. This was a statement win for them and showed that they are still one of the best teams in the NFL.

They will now have a chance to rest up and prepare for their next opponent, which will likely be either the Jacksonville Jaguars or Buffalo Bills. The Jaguars defeated the Steelers 30-9 earlier in the season, but this was before Pittsburgh’s offensive line gelled together. The Bills may be a tougher matchup as they have been playing very well lately.

No matter who their opponent is, the Steelers are heavily favored to reach the Super Bowl. They have shown that they are capable of beating anyone and have one of the best offenses in the league. If their defense can continue to play well then there is no reason why they can’t hoist another Lombardi trophy.
