#  PSG beat Monaco to keep up Scudetto chase 

Paris Saint-Germain successfully kept up the pressure on Serie A leaders Juventus with a 5-1 win over Monaco. 

Neymar opened the scoring for Unai Emery’s side midway through the first half, before Thomas Lemar equalised for the visitors from the spot. However, further goals from Giovani Lo Celso, Angel Di Maria and Kylian Mbappe meant that PSG took all three points and moved to within four points of Juve. 

Monaco had started brightly and could have gone ahead in the seventh minute but Radamel Falcao headed agonisingly wide from close range. The home side then took control of proceedings and Neymar put them ahead in the 23rd minute, turning home Mbappe’s cross from eight yards out. 

However, Monaco were level five minutes later as Lemar drilled a penalty past Alphonse Areola after Brazilian defender Thiago Silva had been adjudged to have fouled Fabinho inside the area. 

But two goals in as many minutes just before half time saw PSG take control of the game. Lo Celso fired home from 20 yards out after good work by Marco Verratti, before Di Maria’s deflected effort found its way past Danijel Subasic in the Monaco goal. 

Mbappe added gloss to the scoreline with two goals in the final 10 minutes, both finishing clinically after being set up by Neymar. It was his sixth goal in six games against his former club Monaco and he now has 26 goals for club and country this season. 

PSG now go into their Champions League last 16 second leg tie against Real Madrid with a slight advantage after winning the first leg 2-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu.

#  Neymar scores as PSG come from behind to win at Lille 

Paris Saint-Germain came from behind to win 3-1 at Lille OSC on Sunday and maintain their unbeaten record in Ligue 1 this season.

Lille took the lead in the 35th minute when captain Ibrahim Amadou headed in from a corner, but Neymar equalized just before halftime with a powerful shot from outside the area.

PSG then dominated after the break, with Kylian Mbappe scoring in the 59th minute and Neymar sealing the victory with a late free kick.

The result leaves PSG eight points clear of second-place Lille, while Marseille — who are four points behind Lille in fourth place — can cut the gap to five points if they win at Bordeaux later on Sunday.

Neymar was making his first start since returning from injury, while Mbappe was playing for the first time since being named world player of the year.

#  Cavani on target as runaway Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain maintain unbeaten start 

The big-spending Paris Saint-Germain maintained their unbeaten start to the Ligue 1 season on Sunday with a 2-0 win over Toulouse, thanks to second-half goals from Edinson Cavani and Lucas.

With Neymar sidelined by a foot injury and Kylian Mbappe only fit enough for a place on the bench, it was left to Cavani to continue his scoring streak.

And the Uruguayan international duly obliged, slotting home from close range after being teed up by Julian Draxler in the 66th minute.

Lucas then made sure of the three points for PSG with an injury-time strike, as Unai Emery's side stayed six points clear of second-placed Monaco.

"Of course we're happy with the result but also our performance," said Emery. "Toulouse are a good team who caused us some problems."

Elsewhere on Sunday, former champions Monaco bounced back from their defeat at PSG last time out with a 3-0 win at Lille.

Two goals in as many minutes midway through the first half from Fabinho and Almamy Toure put Leonardo Jardim's side in control before Radamel Falcao sealed the victory with his 10th goal of the season late on.

#  Neymar, Mbappé injured in dramatic 2-2 draw with Marseille 

 Neymar and Kylian Mbappé were both stretchered off in an eventful 2-2 draw with Marseille that saw both clubs finish with ten men.

Marseille took the lead in the first half when Dimitri Payet converted a penalty, but Neymar equalized midway through the second half. Ten minutes later, Mbappé appeared to have put PSG ahead, but his goal was ruled out for offside.

In the final minute of injury time, substitute Lucas Ocampos fired past Gianluigi Buffon to score what seemed to be a late winner for Marseille – but Neymar had other ideas. The Brazilian superstar controlled a cross on his chest before firing into the top corner in the fifth minute of stoppage time to earn his side a point.

Both Neymar and Mbappé were taken to hospital after the match with ankle injuries, raising fears they could miss next weekend’s showdown against Liverpool in the Champions League.

#  We need to talk about Paris Saint-Germain

The future of Paris Saint-Germain has been a hot topic of debate in the footballing world recently. The French club has been enjoying unprecedented success both domestically and in Europe in recent years, but there are whispers that all is not well behind the scenes.

There is no doubt that Neymar’s world-record transfer to PSG last year has exacerbated the tension, with some reports suggesting that the Brazilian is unhappy with his current situation at the club. In particular, there are suggestions that Neymar is not happy with the amount of time he is spending on the bench, and he is growing increasingly frustrated at being played out of position by head coach Unai Emery.

It’s no secret that Neymar’s switch to PSG was motivated by money rather than a desire to win trophies, and it now looks like he may have made a mistake in choosing the Parc des Princes over perennial Champions League contenders Real Madrid. The Spanish giants are reported to be keen on signing the 27-year-old this summer, and they would undoubtedly be an upgrade on PSG.

Neymar has already won one Champions League trophy during his time at Barcelona, and he would no doubt love to add another to his collection with Real Madrid. Los Blancos also have a much better chance of winning La Liga this season, something which Neymar may find harder to achieve with PSG.

There is no doubt that Neymar is one of the best players in the world, and if he does leave PSG this summer then it will be a huge loss for the club. However, if he does stay then it will be interesting to see how things play out between him and Emery – two egos as big as Neymar’s and Emery’s are not likely to sit well together for very long.
