Hoffman Blackjack is an interesting game that combines the best aspects of blackjack and poker. In this game, players are given two cards and must make a decision whether to hit or stand. They can also choose to fold their hand, which will result in them losing their current bet. If the player has a better hand than the dealer, they will win even money on their bet plus the amount of their original bet. If the player has a worse hand than the dealer, they will lose both their bet and their original bet.

The unique thing about Hoffman Blackjack is that players can also choose to place a side bet known as the “Poker Bonus”. This bet allows players to win up to 100x their original bet if they are able to make a Straight Flush, 4 of a Kind, or Full House. So, for example, if a player bets £5 on the Poker Bonus and then makes a Straight Flush, they would win £500.
