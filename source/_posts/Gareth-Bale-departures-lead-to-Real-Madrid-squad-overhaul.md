#  Gareth Bale departures lead to Real Madrid squad overhaul

Just days after the departure of Gareth Bale to Chinese club Jiangsu Suning, Spanish giants Real Madrid have announced a squad overhaul.

Bale’s exit marks the end of an era for Los Blancos, with club captain Sergio Ramos also set to leave the Santiago Bernabéu.

 Colombian playmaker James Rodríguez is expected to be the next high-profile player out the door, with Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United both interested in his signature.

The arrivals are likely to include Chelsea winger Eden Hazard and Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane.

26-year-old Bale joined Madrid from Tottenham in 2013 for a then world-record fee of £85 million. He won 4 Champions League titles during his time at the club, making him the most decorated British player in history.

#  Los Blancos line-up revealed for 2018/2019 season

The Real Madrid line-up for the 2018/2019 season has been announced, with new signing Eden Hazard set to make his debut.

As expected, former Liverpool player Mohamed Salah misses out, despite speculation that he could make a surprise move to the Spanish capital.

Goalkeeper: Courtois, Keylor Navas

Defenders: Carvajal, Ramos, Varane, Marcelo, Reguilon

Midfielders: Kroos, Modric, Casemiro, Isco

Forwards: Benzema, Bale, Asensio, Lucas Vázquez


It will be interesting to see how new head coach Julen Lopetegui sets up his side in their first competitive match of the season against Atletico Madrid.

#  Thibaut Courtois: new goalkeeper for Madrid?

# Thibaut Courtois has been linked with a move to the Santiago Bernabéu for months now, but the speculation intensified after Keylor Navas’ poor performance in the Champions League final.

# The Costa Rican goalkeeper was at fault for Liverpool’s first goal and was eventually replaced by Sergio Ramos in the second half. Courtois, who is currently on holiday after his World Cup campaign with Belgium, is set to become Real Madrid’s new number one goalkeeper.

# The 26-year-old spent three years on loan at Atlético Madrid between 2011 and 2014 and won the Liga title, the Copa del Rey and the Europa League with Los Colchoneros. He then moved to Chelsea, where he has won two Premier League titles, one FA Cup and one League Cup.

# Courtois is expected to sign a six-year contract with Real Madrid and will become their most expensive goalkeeper ever, overtaking Manchester United’s David De Gea.

#  Who will be the new Real Madrid captain?

After the departure of long-time captain Sergio Ramos, the question of who will take his place as the new Real Madrid captain is one that is on many people’s minds. There are a few contenders for the role, but no clear front runner at this point.

Some of the names that have been mentioned include Luka Modric, Toni Kroos, and Marcelo. All three players have been with Madrid for a long time and are very experienced. They know what it takes to win big matches and lead the team.

Another possible candidate is Gareth Bale. The Welshman has been linked with a move away from Madrid in recent months, but he could still end up being named captain. He is a proven goal scorer and has won plenty of trophies during his time at Madrid.

The final name that has been mentioned is Eden Hazard. The Belgian playmaker has had an excellent first season at Madrid and could be given the captain’s armband next year. He is a leader on the pitch and commands respect from his teammates.

Ramos was an important leader for Madrid both on and off the pitch. Whoever ends up being chosen as his replacement will have big shoes to fill.

#  Sergio Ramos omission from Spain World Cup squad

Spain national team head coach Fernando Hierro has surprised many by omitting Sergio Ramos from his final 23 man squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Ramos was expected to captain Spain at their first World Cup since 2010, but a foot injury sustained in the Champions League Final against Liverpool has seen him miss out.

Ramos was named in Hierro's original 28-man squad, but he has since been replaced by Valencia defender Jose Luis Gaya. This is despite Ramos being included in Spain's provisional squad and being declared fit to travel to Russia by Real Madrid medical staff.

There had been speculation that Ramos may have been left out of the squad because of his disciplinary record, which includes 4 red cards for Spain and 64 yellow cards for club and country. However, Hierro insisted that Ramos' omission was purely down to injury.

"It’s a very hard decision and I don’t want anyone to think it’s something else," said Hierro. "He [Ramos] is an important player who has been with us for a long time."

Ramos took to social media to express his disappointment at not being able to lead Spain at the World Cup. "I am really sad and disappointed," he wrote on Twitter. "I wanted to be there with my team mates making history but unfortunately fate hasn’t allowed me."

Spain are one of the favourites to win the World Cup this year, and they will be looking to lift the trophy for the second time in their history. Hierro's side open their campaign against Portugal on June 15th, before facing Iran and Morocco in Group B.
